        Jewel in the sky Lit me up As you're lit up In the sky The glow in the
        sky Has captured my eye O jewel in the sky Was it just the eye Or it
        caught The soul Through the eye From the sky Deep in the Unknown sky
        Awaiting to be lit up Like the jewel in the sky Jewel in the sky Lit me
        up As you're lit up In the sky</br>
